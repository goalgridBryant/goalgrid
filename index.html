<h1>Goalgrid</h1>
<h3>A framework for reproducible Expected Goals-based analysis in soccer.</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.goalgrid.soccer/validation_match_report_template.html">Test Match Report</a></p>

<p>In 2016, <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/saint-ignatius-college-prep-wolfpack-(chicago,il)/soccer-fall-16/schedule.htm">my final high school soccer season</a> ended in a 1-0 loss that we "should have won." As someone who has always been passionate about that numbers side of sports and was just starting to learn about statistics, I wanted to investigate that "should have won" statement in a more objective manner.</p>
<p>In the days that followed, I learned all about the state of soccer analytics and came across fantastic resources like <a href="https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/">American Soccer Analysis</a>, but I ulitmately was frustrated at the lack of soccer analytics tools that could be applied at the non-professional levels. So I set out to create some tools that could be applied at the non-professional levels.</p>
<p>Hundreds of hours and many iterations later, I finally felt that I had something worth making publicly available. On this site, you will find reports (match reports, player profiles, and team stats in the "goalgrid" format), a framework for recreating the analyses and visualizations shown in the reports (or perhaps creating your own) for your soccer team, and sports analytics, statistics, and programming resources I have found particularly useful on my journey so far.</p>
<p>Hopefully you will enjoy the site, and don't hesitate to reach out!</p>

<p>P.S. Yes, we probably "should have won" that game. But that is how soccer goes sometimes...</p>
