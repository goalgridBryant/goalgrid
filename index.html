    <p class="text-center">In 2016, <a href="https://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/saint-ignatius-college-prep-wolfpack-(chicago,il)/soccer-fall-16/schedule.htm" target="_blank" style="color:#b81f9c;">my final high school soccer season</a> ended in a 1-0 loss that we "should have won." As someone who has always been passionate about that numbers side of sports and was just starting to learn about statistics, I wanted to investigate that "should have won" statement in a more objective manner.</p>
    <p class="text-center">In the days that followed, I learned all about the state of soccer analytics and came across fantastic resources like <a href="https://www.americansocceranalysis.com/" target="_blank" style="color:#b81f9c;">American Soccer Analysis</a>, but I ultimately was frustrated at the lack of soccer analytics tools that could be applied at the non-professional levels. So I set out to create some tools that could be applied at the non-professional levels.</p>
    <p class="text-center">Hundreds of hours and many iterations later, I finally felt that I had something worth making publicly available. On this site, you will find <a href="https://www.goalgrid.soccer/reports/" style="color:#b81f9c;">reports</a> (match reports, player profiles, and team stats in the "goalgrid" format), a <a href="https://www.goalgrid.soccer/library/" style="color:#b81f9c;">framework</a> for recreating the analyses and visualizations shown in the reports (or perhaps creating your own) for your soccer team, <a href="https://www.goalgrid.soccer/future/" style="color:#b81f9c;">more ideas</a> that we didn't have time to get implement, and sports analytics, statistics, and programming <a href="https://www.goalgrid.soccer/resources/" style="color:#b81f9c;">resources</a> I have found particularly useful on my journey so far.</p>
    <p class="text-center">Hopefully you will enjoy the site, and don't hesitate to <a href="https://www.goalgrid.soccer/contact/" style="color:#b81f9c;">reach out!</a></p>

    <p class="text-center">P.S. Yes, we probably "should have won" that game. But that is how soccer goes sometimes...</p>
